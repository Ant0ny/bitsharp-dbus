	* Interfaces/IEngine.cs, Implementation/EngineAdapter.cs: Split the
	  loading of a torrent into two explicit steps. 1) load a .torrent

	  easier detection of when a torrent is already loaded.

	  Implementation/EngineSettingsAdapter.cs: Updated EngineSettings to
	  support the new Encryption API in MonoTorrent
