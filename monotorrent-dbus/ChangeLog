	* Interfaces/IEngine.cs, Implementation/EngineAdapter.cs: Split the
	  loading of a torrent into two explicit steps. 1) load a .torrent
	  file 2) register it to get a downloader. This allows for much
	  easier detection of when a torrent is already loaded.
	* Interfaces/IEngineSettings.cs,
	  Implementation/EngineSettingsAdapter.cs: Updated EngineSettings to
	  support the new Encryption API in MonoTorrent
	* Interfaces/IPeer.cs, Interfaces/ITracker.cs, Interfaces/ITorrent.cs,
	  Interfaces/ITorrentFile.cs, Interfaces/ITorrentService.cs,
	  Interfaces/ITorrentSettings.cs: Added comments to the interface
	  declarations
	* EnumAdapters/EncryptionTypes.cs: Added a 'None' option in
	  EncryptionTypes
	* EnumAdapters/EnumAdapter.cs: Added an adapter for the EncryptionTypes
	  enum
